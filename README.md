# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

```
git reset --hard HEAD and git stash are two different Git commands used for different purposes:

git reset --hard HEAD: This command is used to reset the current branch to the state of the last commit (HEAD). It will discard all changes in your working directory, including staged and unstaged changes. It's a destructive operation and cannot be undone once executed. It's typically used when you want to completely discard all changes and start fresh from the last commit.

git stash: This command is used to temporarily store changes that are not ready to be committed yet. It creates a stash, which is a stack of changes that can be reapplied later. When you run git stash, Git will stash (or save) your changes and revert your working directory to the state of the last commit. You can then continue working on other tasks or switch branches. Later, you can apply the stashed changes back to your working directory using git stash apply or git stash pop. Stashing is typically used when you want to switch to a different task or branch without committing your changes.

In summary:

git reset --hard HEAD is used to permanently discard changes and reset the working directory to the state of the last commit.
git stash is used to temporarily store changes and revert the working directory to the state of the last commit, allowing you to continue working on other tasks or switch branches without committing the changes.
